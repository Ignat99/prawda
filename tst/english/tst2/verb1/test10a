  I saw the thief running away.
  We watched the train steaming past.
  I heard him giving orders.
  Can you smell something burning?
  She could feel her heart beating wildly.
  Did you notice anyone standing near the door?
  We listened to the band playing in the park.
  Just look at the rain coming down!
