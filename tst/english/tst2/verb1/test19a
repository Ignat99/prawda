 She has had her handbag stolen.
 The General had two horses shot under him.
 King Charles I had his head  cut off.
 The soldier had his left leg amputated.
 Some of the houses had their windows broken by the explosion.
 We have had our house  broken into by thieves.
 We have the-enemy almost surrounded.
 They have money  scarcely any saved for their old age.
