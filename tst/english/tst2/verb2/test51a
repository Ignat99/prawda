 It's no use your trying to do that.
 It's no good hoping for their help.
 It won't be much good complaining to the authorities.
 It wouldn't be any good my talking to him.
 It's no use crying over spilt milk.
 It wasn't much use my pretending that I didn't know the rules.
 It was a difficult business getting everything ready in time.
 It's foolish behaving like that.
