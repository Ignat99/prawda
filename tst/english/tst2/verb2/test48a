 The war is over.
 Everything, is at an end between them.
 She is in good health.
 Is he in love?
 We were all out of breath.
 Are these boats for hire?
 Are you in a hurry?
 The fruit is far from ripe.
 Everything else is of no account.
 At last we were at liberty.
 The book is beyond me.
 Is he of age?
 We are not out of danger yet.
 The teacher was in a bad temper.
 The mare is in foal.
 It is of no importance.
 Everything is in good order.
 The machine is out of order.
