 There was no wind .
 There won't be enough time.
 There's no doubt about it.
 There have been many such incidents.
 There is no time for us to visit the Museum now.
 There is a man to see you.
 There entered a strange-looking little man.
 There was every reason for him to be satisfied.
 There's no denying the fact that. . .
 There was much foolish talking.
 There's no getting over it.
 There is a map on page five.
 There was very little work done that day.
