 The leaves are turning brown.
 The dinner smells good.
 Why is he looking angry?
 He is growing old.
 Silk feels soft and smooth.
 This sentence doesn't sound right.
 She married young.
 Everything looks different.
 Please keep quiet.
 The door blew open.
 The fire has burnt low.
 He shammed dead.
 He fell in love.
 One of the tigers broke loose.
 He went mad.
 Your dreams may come true.
 He still remains poor.
 The city lies sleeping.
 The birds came  hopping round my window.
