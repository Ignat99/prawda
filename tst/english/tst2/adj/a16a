Will you be kind enough to help me with this heavy box?
Will you be so kind as to lend me your pen?
This book is too large to go in my pocket.
This book is small enough to go in my pocket.
I've been too busy to write.
They were too tired to go any farther.
We were near enough to see everything.
We were too far away to see anything.
You are old enough to know better.
The child is too young to go to school.
